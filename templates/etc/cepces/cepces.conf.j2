#             is discouraged and untested. It is only included for completness
#             as defined in the MS-XCEP specification.
# * Kerberos
#             Transport level authentication. This is the default where the
#             authentication is performed in the HTTP(s) layer.
# * UsernamePassword
#             Message level authentication. The credentials are used in the
#             message header for authentication.
# * Certificate
#             Transport level authentication. A client certificate is used
#             for TLS client authentication in the HTTPS layer.
